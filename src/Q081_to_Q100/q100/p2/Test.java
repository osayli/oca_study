/**
 Which statement is true?
 A. Both p and s are accessible via obj.
 B. Only s is accessible via obj.
 C. Both r and s are accessible via obj.
 D. p, r, and s are accessible via obj.

 Answer: B


 So, public can be reached from anywhere....
 protected can be reached from the same package,
 and if we need to reach from another package,
 it needs to be extended from parent AND needs to
 create an object from the child class...
 Default only can be reached from same package...
 Private only from same class.
