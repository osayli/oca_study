138. Which statement is true about Java byte code? A. It
can run on any platform.
B. It can run on any platform only if it was compiled for that platform.
C. It can run on any platform that has the Java Runtime Environment.
D. It can run on any platform that has a Java compiler.
E. It can run on any platform only if that platform has both the Java Runtime Environment and a Java
compiler.
Answer: D
Explanation:
Java bytecodes help make "write once, run anywhere" possible. You can compile your program into bytecodes on
any platform that has a Java compiler. The bytecodes can then be run on any implementation of the Java VM.
That means that as long as a computer has a Java VM, the same program written in the Java programming
language can run on Windows 2000, a Solaris workstation, or on an iMac.
